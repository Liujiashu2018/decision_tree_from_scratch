# Building a Decision Tree From Scratch in Python
My journey with tree-based methods began in 2020 when I first encountered decision trees in a machine learning course. Like many students, I started by implementing decision trees using established packages - first with rpart in R, and later with sklearn in Python. Through this experience, I came to appreciate the fundamental importance of decision trees as they serve as the foundation for more advanced tree-based algorithms. This recognition inspired me to build a decision tree algorithm from scratch. By implementing the algorithm myself rather than relying on existing packages, I aim to deepen my understanding of the underlying methodology while strengthening my Python programming skills.
