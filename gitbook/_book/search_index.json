Introduction","keywords":"","body":"1. Introduction\nMy journey with tree-based methods began in 2020 when I first encountered decision trees in a machine learning course. Like many students, I started by implementing decision trees using established packages - first with rpart in R, and later with sklearn in Python. Through this experience, I came to appreciate the fundamental importance of decision trees as they serve as the foundation for more advanced tree-based algorithms. This recognition inspired me to build a decision tree algorithm from scratch. By implementing the algorithm myself rather than relying on existing packages, I aim to deepen my understanding of the underlying methodology while strengthening my Python programming skills.\n"},"CART.html":{"url":"CART.html","title":"2. CART for Decision Tree","keywords":"","body":"2. CART(Classification And Regression Tree) for Decision Tree\nDecision trees are non-parametric supervised learning techniques, meaning they do not assume any specific distribution for the underlying data. Instead, they learn patterns directly from labeled data, where the target variable is known. One of the most widely used decision tree methodologies is CART (Classification and Regression Tree), first introduced by Breiman et al. in 1984. As its name suggests, CART can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, forming the foundation for many modern decision tree algorithms.\nIn this project, I will first review the general structure of the CART algorithm and provide a step-by-step guide to implementing it from scratch using only the pandas and numpy libraries in Python. Lastly, I will test my implementation on Pythonâ€™s built-in datasets â€” the breast cancer dataset (for classification) and the diabetes dataset (for regression). The performance of my implementation will be compared with the established decision tree model available in the scikit-learn library.\n2.1 General Structure\nIn the image below, I tried to show the general structure of a simple decision tree. In this example, the outcome variable Y is binary, indicating whether a patient has heart disease or not:\n\nY = 1: Patient has heart disease.\nY = 0: Patient does not have heart disease.\n\n\nKey Components of a Decision Tree:\n\nRoot Node: The top node of the tree, representing the initial decision point. All data starts here and is split based on the most important feature.\nInternal Node: Also called decision nodes, these are the points where data is further splitted into subgroups based on certain conditions. Each internal node represents a decision or test on a feature.\nLeaf Node: The final node of the tree, containing the output or decision (e.g., whether the patient has heart disease or not). Leaf nodes do not split further.\n\n2.2 Overview of the CART Algorithm Flow\nIn general, the CART algorithm builds a decision tree by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on feature values. The goal is to create pure subsets where the target variable is as homogeneous as possible. Below are the key steps in the CART algorithm.\n\nChoose the Best Split: Search through all the predictors and possible split points (thresholds). Pick the predctor and split point that result in the best split, minimizing impurity (e.g., Gini index for classification or Mean Squared Error for regression). This feature and threshold combination become the root node.\nSplit the Data: Divides the data into two subsets based on the chosen feature and threshold:\nOne subset where the condition is true (e.g., feature value â‰¤ threshold).\nAnother subset where the condition is false (e.g., feature value > threshold).\n\n\nRecursive binary splitting: Starting from the previously formed region. Repeat step 1 and 2, and stop once a stopping criterion is reached. \nAssign Outcomes to Leaf Nodes: Once the stopping criterion is reached and no further splits are possible, assign a final prediction to each leaf node:\nFor classification tasks, assign the majority class of the samples in the node.\nFor regression tasks, assign the mean target value of the samples in the node.\n\n\n\n"},"Metrics.html":{"url":"Metrics.html","title":"3. Metrics to Decide a Good Split","keywords":"","body":"3. Metrics to Decide a Good Split\nThe CART algorithm evaluates possible splits to identify the one that minimizes impurity or error. Different metrics are used depending on the task. \n3.1 Gini Impurity\nSuppose the response variable $Y$ has $C$ different classes, and the tree has $R$ total regions/nodes. We want to first measure the purity of a single node.  \nLet $p$ = proportion of cases in region/node $r$ that are of class $c$,  the node/region's Gini Impurity, or Gini Index, is calculated as:  \nGr=âˆ‘c=1C(pâ‹…(1âˆ’p))\nG_r = \\sum_{c=1}^{C} \\left( p \\cdot (1 - p) \\right)\nGâ€‹râ€‹â€‹=â€‹c=1â€‹âˆ‘â€‹Câ€‹â€‹(pâ‹…(1âˆ’p))\nThe smaller $G$ is, the purer the region $r$ becomes. When $G = 0$, the region is perfectly pure, meaning all samples in the node belong to a single class.\nTo determine the \"best\" binary split, we compute the weighted Gini Impurity as follows:\nGweighted=âˆ‘r=1R(Grâ‹…#Â casesÂ inÂ regionÂ rtotalÂ #Â cases)\nG_{\\text{weighted}} = \\sum_{r=1}^{R} \\left( G_r \\cdot \\frac{\\text{\\# cases in region } r}{\\text{total \\# cases}} \\right)\nGâ€‹weightedâ€‹â€‹=â€‹r=1â€‹âˆ‘â€‹Râ€‹â€‹(Gâ€‹râ€‹â€‹â‹…â€‹totalÂ #Â casesâ€‹â€‹#Â casesÂ inÂ regionÂ râ€‹â€‹)\nThe split with the lowest $G_{\\text{weighted}}$ is considered the \"best\" split. This metric is primarily used in classification tasks.\n# Define Helper Functions\n# Split a dataset based on a feature and a given threshold\ndef split_data (feature_index, threshold, data):\n    left, right = [], []\n    for row in data:\n        if row[feature_index] \n3.2  Entropy\nEntropy is another popular metric for classification tasks, measuring the impurity of a region. Similar to Gini Impurity, lower entropy indicates more homogeneity in a region. \nEntropy is calculated as: \nEntropyr=âˆ’âˆ‘c=1C(pâ‹…log2(p))\nEntropy_r = -\\sum_{c=1}^{C} \\left( p \\cdot log_2(p) \\right)\nEntropyâ€‹râ€‹â€‹=âˆ’â€‹c=1â€‹âˆ‘â€‹Câ€‹â€‹(pâ‹…logâ€‹2â€‹â€‹(p))\nwhere\n\nEntropy_r is the entropy of a region/node $r$.\nC is the total number of classes in the response vairable $Y$.\n$p$ is the proportion of cases in region/node $r$ that beglong to class $c$.\nTo determine the \"best\" binary split using entropy, we compute the weighted entropy as follows:\nEntropyweighted=âˆ‘r=1R(Entropyrâ‹…#Â casesÂ inÂ regionÂ rtotalÂ #Â cases)\nEntropy_{\\text{weighted}} = \\sum_{r=1}^{R} \\left( Entropy_r \\cdot \\frac{\\text{\\# cases in region } r}{\\text{total \\# cases}} \\right)\nEntropyâ€‹weightedâ€‹â€‹=â€‹r=1â€‹âˆ‘â€‹Râ€‹â€‹(Entropyâ€‹râ€‹â€‹â‹…â€‹totalÂ #Â casesâ€‹â€‹#Â casesÂ inÂ regionÂ râ€‹â€‹)\n\n# Entropy\ndef entropy(groups, classes, class_index):\n    total_sample = sum(len(group) for group in groups) \n    weighted_entropy = 0\n    for group in groups:\n        group_size = len(group)\n        if group_size == 0:\n            continue # skip empty groups\n\n        entropy = 0\n        for class_label in classes:\n            class_size = sum(1 for row in group if row[class_index] == class_label)\n            p = class_size/group_size\n            if p > 0:\n                entropy -= p * np.log2(p)\n        weighted_entropy += entropy * (group_size/total_sample)\n\n    return weighted_entropy\n\n3.3 Mean Squared Error (MSE)\nFor regression tasks, we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the metric to measure the impurity of a region. MSE quantifies the variance within a region by calculating the average squared difference between the actual values and the mean value of the region. It is defined as:\nMSEr=1Nrâˆ‘i=1Nr(yiâˆ’yrÂ¯)2\nMSE_r = \\frac{1}{N_r} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_r} \\left( y_i - \\bar{y_r} \\right)^2\nMSEâ€‹râ€‹â€‹=â€‹Nâ€‹râ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹1â€‹â€‹â€‹i=1â€‹âˆ‘â€‹Nâ€‹râ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹(yâ€‹iâ€‹â€‹âˆ’â€‹yâ€‹râ€‹â€‹â€‹Â¯â€‹â€‹)â€‹2â€‹â€‹\nwhere:\n\n$MSE_r$ is the Mean Squared Error for region/node $r$.\n$N_r$ is the number of cases in region $r$.\n$y_i$ represents the true target value of the $i$-th case in region $r$.\n$\\bar{y_r}$ is the mean target value of all cases in region $r$.\n\nThe smaller $MSE_r$ is, the less variance there is in the region, indicating a better split. If $MSE_r = 0$, the region is perfectly pure.\nTo determine the \"best\" binary split using MSE, we compute the weighted MSE as follows:\nMSEweighted=âˆ‘r=1R(MSErâ‹…#Â casesÂ inÂ regionÂ rtotalÂ #Â cases)\nMSE_{\\text{weighted}} = \\sum_{r=1}^{R} \\left( MSE_r \\cdot \\frac{\\text{\\# cases in region } r}{\\text{total \\# cases}} \\right)\nMSEâ€‹weightedâ€‹â€‹=â€‹r=1â€‹âˆ‘â€‹Râ€‹â€‹(MSEâ€‹râ€‹â€‹â‹…â€‹totalÂ #Â casesâ€‹â€‹#Â casesÂ inÂ regionÂ râ€‹â€‹)\n# MSE for regression task\ndef mse(groups, target_index):\n    total_sample = sum(len(group) for group in groups)\n    weighted_mse = 0\n\n    for group in groups:\n        group_size = len(group)\n        if group_size == 0:\n            continue # skip empty groups\n\n        group_value = [row[target_index] for row in group]\n        group_mean = np.mean(group_value)\n        group_mse = sum((x - group_mean) ** 2 for x in group_value) / group_size\n        weighted_mse += group_mse * (group_size/total_sample)\n\n    return weighted_mse\n\n3.4 Finding the best split\nAfter defining functions to compute the metrics for classification and regression tasks, we can create a new function to identify the best split. My find_best_split function incorporates four key elements:\n\nThe input dataset.\nThe index of the target variable column.\nA task parameter that specifies whether the task is classification or regression.\nThe metric used to calculate impurity and evaluate splits (e.g., Gini, Entropy, or MSE).\n\n# Find the best split\ndef find_best_split(data, target_index, task = 'classification', criterion = 'gini'):\n    '''\n    Parameters:\n        data: Input dataset where rows are samples and columns are features.\n        target_index: The index of the column which is chosen to be the target variable.\n        task: Classification or Regression.

Build a Tree\nNow that we've defined all the necessary helper functions, it's time to put everything together and build the decision treeðŸŒ³!\nThe DecisionTree class is designed to handle both classification and regression tasks. As previouly introduced, a decision tree built using the CART algorithm relies on recursively splitting the dataset into smaller subsets. However, this process cannot be endless. To successfully construct a tree, we need to define stopping criteria (e.g., maximum tree depth, minimum number of samples, or reaching a pure region).\nOnce the stopping criteria are met, the algorithm must terminate the recursion and assign a prediction to the node, which becomes a leaf node. To achieve this, I created a leaf_node function first within the class. This function ensures that predictions are assigned to nodes where further splitting is not possible, either because the data cannot be split further or the stopping conditions have been reached. \nThe fit function orchestrates the training process by invoking the recursive_splitting function, which builds the tree step-by-step. Once the tree is built, it is stored in the self.tree attribute.\nThe predict function is used to traverse the built tree and generate predictions for new input samples. Starting from the root node, it follows the feature-based split conditions until it reaches a leaf node, where the prediction is returned. This function allows the trained decision tree to be applied effectively to unseen data.\n# Build a tree\nclass DecisionTree:\n    def __init__(self, task = 'classification', criterion = 'gini', min_sample=2, max_depth=None):\n        self.task = task \n        self.criterion = criterion\n        self.min_sample = min_sample\n        self.max_depth = max_depth\n        self.tree = None\n\n    def leaf_node(self, data, target_index):\n        target_val = [row[target_index] for row in data]\n        if self.task == 'classification':\n             # Find the most frequent element (class label) in the list\n            return max(set(target_val), key = target_val.count)\n        else:\n            return np.mean(target_val)\n\n    def recursive_splitting(self, data, target_index, depth = 0):\n        # Define a stopping criteria \n        if depth >= self.max_depth or len(data)\n"},"Testing.html":{"url":"Testing.html","title":"5.

Testing the Algorithm\n5.1 Testing case: Predicting Breast Cancer\nTo evaluate the algorithm's performance for classification tasks, I tested it using the Breast Cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The target variable in this dataset is binary, with two classes: 'malignant' and 'benign'. The goal of this test case is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.\nI first applied the custom decision tree algorithm to perform the classification task. Then, I compared its performance to the sklearn DecisionTreeClassifier. Both algorithms were tested using the same training and testing datasets, and the classification was performed using the Gini impurity criterion.\nThe results show that our custom algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.98%, which is slightly lower than the 95% accuracy achieved by the sklearn implementation. This indicates that our custom algorithm can handle classification tasks effectively, but there is still room for improvement and optimization.\n# Test case: Predicting Breast Cancer\n# Load data\nbreast_cancer = load_breast_cancer()\n# print (breast_cancer.feature_names)\n# print (breast_cancer.target_names)\ndata = pd.DataFrame(data=breast_cancer.data, columns=breast_cancer.feature_names)\ndata['target'] = breast_cancer.target\n# Split data into test and train\nX = data.iloc[:, :-1]\ny = data['target']\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\nPredict using my custom algorithm:\n# Testing the algorithm using the customed alogrithm\ntrain_data = np.hstack((X_train.values, y_train.values.reshape(-1, 1)))  # Merge features and target\ntarget_index = train_data.shape[1] - 1  \ntree = DecisionTree(max_depth=5, min_sample=10) \ntree.fit(train_data, target_index)\nprint(tree.tree)\ntree_structure = tree.tree\n\n# Predict using test set\npredictions = [tree.predict(row) for row in X_test.values]\n\n# Evaluate the model\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%\")\n\nPredict using sklearn:\n# Build the decision tree using the sklearn package\ndecision_tree_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='gini', random_state=42)\ndecision_tree_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\npredictions = decision_tree_classifier.predict(X_test)\nprint(f\"Model's Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions):.2f}\")\n\n5.1.1 Decision Tree Visualization\nThe plot_tree function from the sklearn library is a commonly used tool when we want to visualize decision trees. However, to visualize the custom decision tree and better understand its structure and performance, I created a function that converts a tree dictionary into a DOT format file. This approach allows for a clear visualization of the tree and was inspired by a blog post. \n# Decision Tree Visulization (custom)\ndef write_dot_file(tree, filepath, attrs=None, classes=None, depth=0, node_id=0):\n    '''\n    Convert a tree dictionary into a DOT file format.\n\n    Parameters:\n        tree: The tree structure as a nested dictionary.\n        filepath: Path to save the DOT file.\n        attrs: Feature names (optional).\n        classes: Class names (optional).\n        depth: Current depth (used internally for recursive node indexing).\n        node_id: Current node ID (used internally for recursive node indexing).\n\n    Returns:\n        The next available node_id for indexing.\n    '''\n    def node_label(node):\n        if isinstance(node, dict): # If the node is a dictionary, it is a terminal/decision node.\n            # if attrs:\n            #     feature = attrs[node['feature']]\n            # else:\n            #     feature = f\"Feature {node['feature']}\"\n            feature = attrs[node['feature']] if attrs else f\"Feature {node['feature']}\"\n            return f\"{feature}  {current_id};\\n')\n\n            # Recurse for left and right children if node is a terminal/decision node\n            if isinstance(node, dict):\n                recurse(node['left'], current_id)\n                recurse(node['right'], current_id)\n\n        recurse(tree)\n        dot_file.write(\"}\")\n\nfeature_names = list(X_train.columns) \nclass_names = [\"Malignant\", \"Benign\"] \n\n# Save the tree as a DOT file\nwrite_dot_file(\n    tree=tree_structure,\n    filepath=\"decision_tree_update.dot\",\n    attrs=feature_names,\n    classes=class_names\n)\n# Source.from_file(\"decision_tree_update.dot\").view()\n\n\nBelow is the visualization of the decision tree generated using the sklearn package, created with the plot_tree function.\n\n5.2 Testing case: Predicting Diabetes\nTo evaluate the algorithm's performance for regression tasks, I tested it using the Diabetes dataset from the sklearn library. This dataset contains 10 predictors and a target variable representing a quantitative measure of disease progression. See the full dataset description. \nAgain, the goal of this test is to compare the custom decision tree regressor against sklearn's DecisionTreeRegressor using the same training and testing datasets. The performance is assessed using common regression metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² Score.\nBoth models achieve the same RÂ² score (0.33) and show similar results for MSE and MAE, indicating a moderate fit to the data. While neither model fully captures the variance in the dataset, the results validate that our custom algorithm performs effectively and is competitive with sklearn's implementation.\ndiabetes = load_diabetes()\n# print(pd.isna(diabetes)) # check NA values\ndata_reg = pd.DataFrame(data=diabetes.data, columns=diabetes.feature_names)\ndata_reg['target'] = diabetes.target\n# Split data into test and train\nX = data_reg.iloc[:, :-1]\ny = data_reg['target']\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\nPredict using my custom algorithm:\n# Combine X_train and y_train for custom algorithms\ntrain_data = np.hstack((X_train.values, y_train.values.reshape(-1, 1))) \ntarget_index = train_data.shape[1] - 1  \nreg_tree = DecisionTree(task = 'regression', criterion= 'mse', max_depth=5, min_sample=10) \nreg_tree.fit(train_data, target_index)\nprint(reg_tree.tree)\n\n# Predict\ntree_structure = reg_tree.tree\nreg_predictions = [reg_tree.predict(row) for row in X_test.values]\n\n# Evaluate custom Decision Tree for regression\ncustom_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, reg_predictions)\ncustom_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, reg_predictions)\ncustom_r2 = r2_score(y_test, reg_predictions)\n\nModel Comparision:\n\n"},"conclusion.html":{"url":"conclusion.html","title":"6. Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"6. Conclusion\nNow we have seen how to build a basic decision tree from scratch using only pandas and numpy. Despite its simplicity, the custom algorithm performs reasonably well on both classification and regression tasks, as demonstrated with the breast cancer and diabetes datasets.\nThis project highlights the core mechanics of the CART algorithm, including recursive splitting, calculating metrics like Gini impurity and MSE, and defining stopping criteria to avoid overfitting. By comparing the custom decision tree with sklearn's implementation, we observed that the custom model achieves comparable results, validating the robustness of the algorithm.\nBuilding this decision tree from scratch has been both a challenging and rewarding journey. I enjoyed the process of deepening my understanding of the underlying algorithm. There are certainly opportunities for further enhancements, such as adding support for pruning to reduce overfitting. My next step is probably to sracth other algorithm based on the decision tree framework, such as the Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees.\n"}}}
